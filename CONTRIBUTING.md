## Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-ios-skills.git
   cd claude-code-ios-skills
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/skill-name` - New skills
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-description` - Documentation
- `refactor/skill-name` - Refactoring

**Examples:**
- `feature/unit-testing-skill`
- `fix/swift-patterns-force-unwrap`
- `docs/add-usage-examples`
- `refactor/ui-review-modularization`

## Skill Development Guidelines

### File Structure

Follow the established pattern:

**Simple Skills** (< 400 lines):
```
skills/skill-name/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md
```

**Complex Skills** (> 400 lines):
```
skills/skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns.md        # Patterns and anti-patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checklist.md       # Comprehensive checklist
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples.md        # Code examples
```

### SKILL.md Format

Every SKILL.md must have:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description (1-2 sentences)
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit]
---
```

Followed by:

1. **Skill Name**: H1 heading
2. **When This Skill Activates**: Clear trigger conditions
3. **Process**: Step-by-step workflow
4. **Output Format**: How to present results
5. **Examples**: Concrete examples (optional)
6. **References**: External links (optional)

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill names**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `code-reviewer`)
- **File names**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `swift-patterns.md`)
- **No spaces or underscores**

### Code Examples

All code examples should:

- Be syntactically correct
- Show both bad (‚ùå) and good (‚úÖ) patterns
- Include explanatory comments
- Use realistic scenarios

**Format:**

```markdown
### Example: Handling Optionals

#### ‚ùå Anti-pattern
```swift
let name = user.name! // Crashes if nil
```

#### ‚úÖ Good pattern
```swift
guard let name = user.name else {
    return
}
```

#### Why?
Force unwrapping will crash if the value is nil. Guard provides safe unwrapping with early return.
```

### Markdown Style

- Use `###` for sections, `####` for subsections
- Code blocks with language: ` ```swift `
- Lists with `-` or `1.`
- Tables for comparisons
- Bold for **emphasis**, italic for *terms*

### Content Guidelines

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Be clear and concise
- ‚úÖ Provide concrete examples
- ‚úÖ Explain the "why," not just "what"
- ‚úÖ Reference official documentation
- ‚úÖ Use proper technical terms
- ‚úÖ Keep it up-to-date

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Use vague descriptions
- ‚ùå Provide opinions without reasoning
- ‚ùå Include outdated practices
- ‚ùå Copy copyrighted material
- ‚ùå Add project-specific details
