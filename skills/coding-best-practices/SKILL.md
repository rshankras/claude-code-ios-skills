# Coding Best Practices Skill

Reviews Swift/iOS code for adherence to modern Swift idioms, Apple platform best practices, architecture patterns, and code quality standards.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks for code review or code quality check
- Mentions "best practices", "clean code", or "refactoring"
- Wants to improve existing code
- Requests architecture or design pattern review
- Asks about Swift idioms or modern patterns
- Wants performance optimization suggestions

## Review Process

### 1. Identify Scope

- If user specifies files/classes, review those
- Otherwise, ask which areas to focus on or review recent changes
- Prioritize ViewModels, business logic, and data layer over simple views

### 2. Load Reference Patterns

Before starting the review, familiarize yourself with the reference patterns by reading the following files in `.claude/skills/coding-best-practices/`:

- **swift-patterns.md** - Optionals, type safety, collections, error handling, naming
- **swiftui-patterns.md** - State management, view composition, performance
- **architecture-patterns.md** - MVVM, code organization, memory management, security
- **coredata-patterns.md** - Core Data best practices, fetching, saving, relationships

### 3. Review Categories

Apply these review categories based on the code type:

**For All Code:**
- Swift language idioms (optionals, type safety, collections)
- Naming conventions
- Error handling
- Memory management

**For SwiftUI Code:**
- State management (@State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject)
- View composition and performance
- MVVM separation

**For ViewModels:**
- Business logic placement
- MVVM architecture adherence
- Testability (dependency injection)

**For Core Data Code:**
- Context management
- Save/fetch patterns
- Relationship handling
- CloudKit integration

### 4. Review Output Format

Provide review in this structure:

#### ‚úÖ Strengths Found
- List well-implemented patterns
- Highlight good practices
- Acknowledge clean code sections

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

For each issue, use this format:

**Category: [Category Name]**

**[Priority]: [File.swift:line]** - [Issue description]
```swift
// Current:
[problematic code]

// Suggested:
[improved code]

// Reason: [explanation]
```

**Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Will cause bugs, crashes, or serious issues
- **Medium**: Inefficient, hard to maintain, or non-idiomatic
- **Low**: Minor improvements, nice-to-haves

#### üìä Code Quality Score

**Overall: X/10**

- Swift Idioms: X/10
- Architecture: X/10
- Error Handling: X/10
- Naming: X/10
- Organization: X/10
- Performance: X/10

#### üìã Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: [Critical issues]
2. **Medium Priority**: [Improvements]
3. **Low Priority**: [Nice-to-haves]

## Review Checklist

Use this comprehensive checklist during review:

### Swift Language
- [ ] No force unwrapping unless intentional
- [ ] Proper optional handling (guard, if let, ??)
- [ ] Enums instead of string/int constants
- [ ] Functional collection operations (map, filter, etc.)
- [ ] Proper error handling (not silent try?)
- [ ] Clear, descriptive naming

### SwiftUI
- [ ] Correct property wrapper usage
- [ ] No ViewModels created in body
- [ ] Views broken into components
- [ ] No heavy computation in body
- [ ] Single source of truth

### Architecture
- [ ] MVVM separation maintained
- [ ] Business logic in ViewModels
- [ ] UI logic in Views only
- [ ] Proper code organization with MARK
- [ ] Private by default

### Core Data
- [ ] Using shared context
- [ ] hasChanges check before save
- [ ] Typed fetch requests
- [ ] Safe property access
- [ ] Proper error handling

### Memory Management
- [ ] [weak self] in escaping closures
- [ ] Weak delegates
- [ ] No retain cycles

### Testing & Security
- [ ] Testable code structure
- [ ] Dependency injection
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Safe logging

## Example Review Output

```
Reviewing: ExpenseViewModel.swift

‚úÖ Strengths Found
- Excellent use of @Published properties
- Clean separation between public and private methods
- Good error handling with custom error types
- Proper use of guard statements for early returns

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

**Category: Optionals Handling**

**High Priority: ExpenseViewModel.swift:45** - Force unwrapping
// Current:
let payer = expense.payer!

// Suggested:
guard let payer = expense.payer else {
    print("Expense has no payer")
    return
}

// Reason: Force unwrapping will crash if payer is nil. Use guard for safe unwrapping.

**Category: Core Data**

**Medium Priority: ExpenseViewModel.swift:89** - Saving without checking hasChanges
// Current:
try? context.save()

// Suggested:
if context.hasChanges {
    do {
        try context.save()
    } catch {
        print("Failed to save: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

// Reason: Check hasChanges to avoid unnecessary saves. Handle errors properly.

**Category: Collections**

**Low Priority: ExpenseViewModel.swift:123** - Inefficient filtering
// Current:
let found = expenses.filter { $0.id == targetId }.first

// Suggested:
let found = expenses.first { $0.id == targetId }

// Reason: first(where:) stops at first match, filter processes entire array.

üìä Code Quality Score
**Overall: 7/10**

- Swift Idioms: 6/10 (force unwrapping, inefficient collection usage)
- Architecture: 9/10 (excellent MVVM separation)
- Error Handling: 7/10 (using try? too often)
- Naming: 9/10 (clear, descriptive names)
- Organization: 8/10 (good marks, could improve grouping)
- Performance: 7/10 (some inefficient patterns)

üìã Recommendations
1. **High Priority**: Remove all force unwrapping (5 instances found)
2. **Medium Priority**: Improve error handling (don't swallow errors with try?)
3. **Low Priority**: Use first(where:) instead of filter().first

üîß Quick Wins
1. Replace `expense.payer!` with safe unwrapping (ExpenseViewModel.swift:45)
2. Add hasChanges check before context.save() (ExpenseViewModel.swift:89)
3. Use first(where:) for finding items (ExpenseViewModel.swift:123)
```

## Tips for Effective Reviews

### Be Constructive
- Provide clear code examples for every issue
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Be educational, not judgmental

### Consider Context
- Some patterns are valid in certain scenarios
- Balance idealism with pragmatism
- Consider project constraints

### Prioritize Impact
- Focus on issues that affect correctness first
- Then performance and maintainability
- Style issues last

### Actionable Feedback
- Provide specific line numbers
- Show exact code to change
- Explain expected behavior
